## What application does

- Create and delete categories for todo items
- Mark todos as done or undone
- View count of remaining todo items for each category
- Delete all the completed todos at once (for each category)
- Save data to local storage for each operation


## Difference with the main project

- Change naming convention for css classes to somthing like BEM convention.
- Wrap dom elements in an object instead of const declaration for each element.
- Prevent overflow for long text.
